This is my second webpage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What it does is pretty self-explanatory, it is an Etch A Sketch board! However, it is no ordinary Etch A Sketch board, it has some functionalities that a regular board does not:
- Multiple color options available
- Eraser tool
# Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
# Difficulties Encountered
- When you draw, the pixel that you started with may not be colored (Not yet fixed)
- If the mouse moves too quickly, there will be gaps in the drawing (Not yet fixed)
# Task list
-[ ] Fix the above two things
-[ ] In addition to the preset colors, add a color picker so that a specific color can be picked.
